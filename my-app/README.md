HealthyHabits_Tracker
Context:
Maintaining healthy habits and routines, such as meditation, hydration, sleep, and workouts, can greatly improve overall well-being. This app helps users track and build healthy habits across various aspects of life, providing a holistic approach to health and wellness.

Project Goal:
Develop a habit tracker that allows users to create and monitor habits in different categories such as fitness, nutrition, mindfulness, and sleep. The app will motivate users to stay consistent by providing insights, progress tracking, and habit streaks.

Users can create habits across different categories (e.g., fitness, hydration, sleep, meditation).
For each habit, allow users to specify daily/weekly goals (e.g., drink 8 glasses of water daily, meditate for 10 minutes, exercise 3 times a week).
Allow users to log the completion of their habits daily, and display their progress visually.
Goal Setting for Each Habit:

Users set achievable goals for each habit (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water per day") and receive notifications to complete them.
Habit Progress Tracking:

Track the progress of each habit with visual charts showing streaks and goal completion rates (e.g., percentage of days habits were completed in a week).
Habit Streaks:

Track habit completion streaks to keep users motivated (e.g., "Youâ€™ve completed your meditation habit for 7 days in a row!").
Daily and Weekly Summaries:

Provide users with a daily and weekly summary of their habit performance, helping them visualize where they excel and what habits need improvement.

Send reminders to users for habit completion (e.g., "It's time to drink water!" or "Don't forget to meditate today").
Unique Features

Calculate a Wellness Score based on how consistently users complete habits in different categories. For example, combine fitness (exercise frequency), sleep, hydration, and mindfulness habits to give a holistic score representing their overall wellness.
Display the Wellness Score on a dashboard, and show how it changes over time based on habit performance.
Reminders in case of wellness score is dropping
Habit Analytics Dashboard:

Create a Habit Analytics Dashboard that displays user statistics in detail. This includes the number of habits tracked, completion rates for each habit, best and worst-performing habits, and graphs showing weekly and monthly trends.
Help users identify which areas of their health and well-being they are neglecting (e.g., sleep or hydration) by providing visual feedback.
Use good animations, Styles to highlight the drop of wellness score and its effects
Challenging Features
Health Sync with Devices:

Integrate the app with third-party health services (such as Google Fit or Apple Health) to auto-log fitness and sleep data. For example, sync sleep tracking from a user's smartwatch or fitness device to automatically track sleep habits in the app.
AI-Powered Habit Recommendations:

Implement a simple AI system that analyzes a user's past habit completion patterns (e.g., workouts, hydration, sleep) and suggests new habits to balance their wellness journey. For instance, if the user is consistent with workouts but neglects sleep, the app could recommend better sleep routines or meditation.
Custom Habit Challenges:

Allow users to create habit challenges with friends or community members (e.g., "Hydrate with me for 30 days").
Provide a leaderboard showing challenge participants and their progress, motivating users through a bit of healthy competition.
Additional Features:

Mood Tracking: Allow users to log their mood daily, providing a way to reflect on how their habits impact their mental well-being.

The shared milestones can include a visual summary of their progress and goals.
